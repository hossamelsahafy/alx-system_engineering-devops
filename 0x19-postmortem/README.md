# Project Phoenix (Python Edition) Outage Postmortem ü§ñüí•

## Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:** The outage started at 2:00 PM GMT on April 8, 2024, and ended at 4:30 PM GMT on the same day.
**Impact:** The container packaging service was down. Users were unable to package their files into containers. Approximately 35% of the users were affected.
**Root Cause:** A bug in the file compression module caused the service to crash.

## Root Cause and Resolution üêõüîß

**Root Cause:** The issue was caused by a bug in the file compression module. Specifically, the module was not correctly handling certain types of files, which caused it to enter an infinite loop and eventually crash the service. It was like the module was trying to compress a file that was already a perfect square - an endless task!

**Resolution:** The bug was fixed by adding a condition to correctly handle all types of files. A hotfix was applied to the live service, and the service was back online and functioning normally, just in time for the users to package their files and get back to their daily grind.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures üí™

**Improvements:**

- Improve the error handling in the file compression module to handle unexpected file types gracefully, like using a "Huffman Dance" to compress the data.
- Add more comprehensive tests for the file compression module, including some "edge cases" like compressing a file that's already a perfect cube.

**Tasks:**

- Patch the file compression module with the new bug fix.
- Add monitoring on the file compression module to detect any future issues before they become a problem.
- Review and improve the test coverage of the file compression module, making sure it can handle any file that's thrown its way, even if it's in the shape of a dodecahedron.
